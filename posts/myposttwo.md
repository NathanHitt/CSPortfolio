While I have not focused on these in a while, I have a good deal of knowledge in Linux System administration and penetration testing. I have taught myself the basics of the metasploit framework, cross site scripting, burpsuite, and brute force password attacks such as list attacks. In a lab, I have hacked a virtual machine to perforrm a reverse-tcp attack and gain access to administrator control. I followed the guide here: 
https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2-exploitability-guide/

I also have some basic knowledge in assembly, knowledge on Linux kernel programs and operations. I have experimented with C# and Unity to create games, which I could send you if you are interested. 

I am working on getting my CompTia A+ Cert so that I can get some basic IT experience and hopefully get a job in the field.
