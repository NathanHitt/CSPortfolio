Currently I have been working on, as you can tell, web-development. I have been working with a lot of javascript, specifically the framework React. Since I taught myself HTML, Javascript, and CSS, I can use React to build more complicated and dynamic webpages. This is because the framework allows you to write HTML and CSS within javascript components, making the entire web-devlopment process much more integrated and useful. I have also been teaching myself web-development frameworks such as NextJS. This allows you to create react applicaitons which also have the ability to communicate with a backend database applicatioin such as MongoDB. This is how the blogging application works, as it utilizes NextJs function calls to query json data from an internal database. It does this by assigning queriable data to specific props attributes, which can then be referenced by React components and passed down to them to render the data as HTML and CSS components. 

I am also working on utilziing this funcitonallity in conjunction with a python web scraper, where I can store this info as json data which could be rendered from a react application. This would allow me to scrape web information, say twitter tweets, and aggregate information about them into easily digestable information on a website.
